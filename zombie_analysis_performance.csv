Area,Implementation,Performance_Score,Bottleneck_Risk
Memory Management,"Transaction-safe spawning with rollback, double-removal prevention",9,Low - Proper memory management with cleanup
CPU Optimization,"Tick-based system (no setInterval), chunked operations, update batching",9,Low - Efficient tick-based processing
Network Efficiency,Standard player packets reused for zombies - no extra bandwidth,8,Low - Reuses existing packet infrastructure
Garbage Collection,"Proper cleanup in ZombieManager, timeout management in Game class",9,Low - Comprehensive cleanup procedures
Algorithmic Complexity,"O(n) zombie updates, O(log n) spatial queries with grid system",9,Medium - May degrade with 20+ zombies
Caching Strategy,"Grid-based spatial partitioning, chunk tracking for spawning",8,Low - Effective spatial partitioning
Resource Pooling,"Object pooling for bullets/explosions, ID recycling system",9,Low - Proper resource management
Scalability Design,Dynamic spawning system scales with player count and game time,9,Low - Well-designed scaling mechanisms
