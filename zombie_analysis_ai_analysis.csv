Algorithm,Implementation,Complexity_Score,Quality_Rating
State Machine Design,"6-state FSM: Idle, Wandering, Hunting, Attacking, Fleeing, Grouping",8,Excellent - Clean state transitions with proper edge cases
Pathfinding Implementation,A* pathfinding with obstacle avoidance and intermediate waypoints,9,Professional - Proper A* with heuristics and optimization
Collision Avoidance,"Advanced separation forces, circling behavior, anti-stuck mechanisms",10,Outstanding - Multiple avoidance layers prevent common issues
Pack Behavior,Sophisticated pack coordination with target sharing,8,Good - Effective group behaviors without over-coordination
Decision Making,Multi-factor decision trees with aggro timeout and health thresholds,9,Advanced - Context-aware decisions with multiple inputs
Performance Optimization,Tick-based updates with 500ms pathfinding intervals,9,"Excellent - No performance bottlenecks, scalable design"
Behavioral Complexity,Emergent behaviors from simple rules - realistic zombie swarms,9,Outstanding - Complex emergent behaviors from simple rules
Learning Capability,Static rule-based (no ML) but sophisticated reactive behaviors,7,Good - Rule-based but could benefit from adaptive behaviors
