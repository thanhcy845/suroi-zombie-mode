# Suroi v0.2.0

## New features
- Guns! Added the AK-47 and M3K. More guns will be added soon, including the Mosin-Nagant.
- Health crates! These crates restore your health when broken. They are a temporary addition and will be removed once proper healing items are added.
- Keybinds! You can now remap keys. To edit keybinds, click the gear icon in the bottom right, or in-game, press Escape and click on Settings. Then, click on the Keybinds tab.

## Bug fixes
- Fixed a visual bug causing players' fists to get stuck in the punching position.
