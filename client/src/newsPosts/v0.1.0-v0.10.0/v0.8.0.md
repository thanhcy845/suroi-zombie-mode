H.A.Z.E.L. has made various improvements to weapons systems to refine them further, and a small shipment of antiquated arms has been received from Flint Industries. Scouts have explored more of the island. We've mapped out the gas release points, allowing us to predict the gas's movement accurately. Additionally, new AR software updates have been pushed out to ensure battle readiness.
