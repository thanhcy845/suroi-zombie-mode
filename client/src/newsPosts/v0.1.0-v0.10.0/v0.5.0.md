The newest supply shipment to the island has arrived, along with a slew of new weapons! Blast enemies all day long with the 47 round pan on the Lewis gun, or test your marksmanship with the Tango 51. Prefer hand-to-hand combat? The K-bar or the baseball bat may be for you. A glint of gold may yield a fruitful surprise...

# Suroi v0.5.0

## New features
- Ammo and reloading! Guns now require ammo and need to be reloaded.
- Melee weapons! Added 2 melee weapons: the K-bar (a knife), and the baseball bat.
- More guns! Added 6 guns: the Lewis Gun (an LMG), MCX Spear (an assault rifle), Micro Uzi (an SMG), Tango 51 (a sniper), 940 Pro (a shotgun), and M16A4 (a burst fire assault rifle).
- New crates! Added the AEGIS and Flint crates, which drop better loot than regular crates. Also added gauze, cola, and melee crates.
- New obstacles! Added the oil tank, gold rock, and birch tree. The oil tank is an indestructible obstacle that makes for good cover. The gold rock drops a Mosin-Nagant; only one spawns per map.
- More obstacle variations! Added mossy and cracked variants of the rock.
