H.A.Z.E.L. intelligence officers have become aware of a new structure built covertly by Flint Industries, a state-of-the-art facility known only as **Fulcrum**. According to rumors, it houses the new **SVU-A**, a high-powered suppressed 7.62mm battle rifle. These rumors are as yet unconfirmed; it is unknown whether the structure actually exists, or where it is located.

In order to facilitate the distribution of airdrops, the radio has been replaced with the **Flare**. As usual, this update has a few bug fixes and improvements to check out, most notable of which is tree leaves becoming transparent as you approach them.
