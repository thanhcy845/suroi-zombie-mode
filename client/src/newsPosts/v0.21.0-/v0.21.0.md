**Happy Halloween!** It's that time of year again, and the Plumpkins have broken out of the bunker, leaving the island covered in brand new perk opportunities. The Harvest map has been changed to fit the festivities, with a delightfully spooky theme.

For a limited time, **13 brand new Halloween exclusive perks** will be available to pick up alongside the normal perks. There's no need to choose between one or the other: You can have one of each!

Halloween will run for **3 days**, until 8 PM EST, Nov 3rd.
