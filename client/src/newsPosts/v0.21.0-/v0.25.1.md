Our containment crews have managed to eradicate every last trace of the sudden takeover of the island last week. However, our laboratory research indicates a continued risk of possible new variants of *Cucurbita purpureus*, which could reinfect the island.

We are taking this opportunity to strengthen our foothold on the island to resist future epidemics. Numerous fixes and optimizations will be noticed around the island, particularly in sound, UI, and our supporting partners.
