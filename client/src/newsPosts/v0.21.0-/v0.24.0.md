February 14th marked two years since our main inspiration, Surviv.io, closed down for good. In honor, we've prepared a host of long-awaited gameplay changes, as well as added a new structure and two new guns. The game has also been switched to Classic mode.

The gas zone has been entirely reworked from the ground up. Zones are now more fair, better spaced, and an exciting new final ring has been implemented. We've increased the base movement speed, as well as reworked adrenaline to give more speed and less health while also giving larger benefits for lower levels of adrenaline. Due to the popularity of our test in Harvest, the 2x scope has been made a default scope, and we've also added new art for all scope variants.

The **MP5k** is a brand new burst machine pistol found almost anywhere other mid tier weapons can be spawn. Boasting an impressive DPS and controllable spread, this moderate ranged 9mm gun excels in both dual and single wield.

The **Memorial** is a solemn monument to our predecessor. Pay your respects to the fallen, and you may just find one last gift waiting... the **PK-61**. Predecessor to the legendary PKM, this high capacity machine gun features excellent accuracy and damage, especially to obstacles, at the cost of a low fire rate. Also added to the Memorial is the **Kukri**, a fast short range melee with moderate damage.

There have been a wide variety of fixes, updates, and rebalances to most aspects of the game, including several weapons, explosives, object health, and much more.
