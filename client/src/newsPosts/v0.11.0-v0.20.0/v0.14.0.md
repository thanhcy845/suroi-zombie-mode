The weather grows cold, the trees lose their leaves, and the snowdrifts pile high. But we've got a couple new features to spice up the winter season! The entire map has been reskinned to frosty perfection, with more surprises in store soon! Also, we've added the long-awaited dual-wielding feature for pistolsâ€”if one isn't enough, grab another for twice the firepower!

Of course, we've made a few changes and fixes, including a circular action timer, reworked airdrops, and a larger map grid. Go warm yourself up with a toasty chicken dinner!
